# E-commerce Web Scraping Suite

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to scrape product data from the following e-commerce websites:
- **Foreign Fortune**
- **Le Chocolat Alain Ducasse**
- **Trader Joe's**

The scripts use **Pyppeteer** (a Python implementation of Puppeteer) to perform headless browsing and interact with dynamic web pages, while **Parsel** is used for parsing the HTML content and extracting relevant data such as product details, prices, and images. The scraped data is saved in JSON format, and a summary of the number of products scraped is stored in text files.

## Features
- Scrapes multiple categories from each website.
- Extracts product details including title, description, price, images, weight, sizes, colors, and more.
- Handles pagination and dynamic loading of content.
- Saves the scraped data in structured JSON files.
- Logs the total number of products scraped from each website.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Pyppeteer**: A Python version of Puppeteer to control headless Chrome/Chromium browsers.
- **Parsel**: A web scraping library for extracting data from HTML and XML using XPath and CSS selectors.
- **Asyncio**: For asynchronous operations to improve performance during web scraping.

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher and the following dependencies:
- Pyppeteer
- Parsel
- Asyncio

To install the dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jordan552/web_Scraping/new/main/Python_Pyppteer/python
   cd python
   ```

2. **Install Google Chrome or Chromium**:
   Make sure Chrome or Chromium is installed on your system and update the `executablePath` in the scripts to point to the location of your Chrome/Chromium executable.

3. **Install required Python libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install pyppeteer parsel asyncio
   ```

4. **Adjust paths** if needed (especially for Chrome executable path in each script).

## Running the Scripts
Each script can be run independently. Navigate to the directory and run the script you want:
```bash
python foreignfortune.py
python lechocolat.py
python traderjoes.py
```

## How the Scripts Work

### 1. Foreign Fortune Scraper
- **Categories Scraped**: Men/Unisex, Women, Infant/Kids, Coats/Hats, TrackSuits, Accessories.
- **Details Extracted**:
  - Product title, description, sizes, colors, price per size and color combination, images.
  - The script automatically handles pop-ups and pagination, ensuring all products are scraped.
  
- **How It Works**:
  - The script first navigates to each category URL and detects the total number of pages.
  - It extracts product URLs from each page, then visits each product page to gather detailed information including variant data (sizes and colors).
  - The data is structured and saved into JSON files.

- **Sample Output**:
  ```json
  {
    "product_id": "12345",
    "title": "Men's T-Shirt",
    "description": "A stylish and comfortable t-shirt for men.",
    "sale_prices": [19.99, 24.99],
    "images": ["https://foreignfortune.com/image1.jpg"],
    "category": "Men/Unisex",
    "models": [
      {
        "color": "Blue",
        "variants": [
          {"size": "S", "price": 19.99, "image": "https://foreignfortune.com/image1.jpg"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### 2. Le Chocolat Scraper
- **Categories Scraped**: Gifts, Boxes, Bars, Simple Pleasures, Breakfast & Snacks.
- **Details Extracted**:
  - Product title, description, price (per kilo and per item), weight, images.
  
- **How It Works**:
  - The script navigates to each category page, extracts the product URLs, and scrapes details for each product.
  - The price per kilo is calculated, and the final price is computed based on product weight.
  
- **Sample Output**:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Chocolate Gift Box",
    "description": "A luxurious box of assorted chocolates.",
    "price_per_kg": 99.99,
    "price": 29.99,
    "weight": 300,
    "images": ["https://www.lechocolat-alainducasse.com/image1.jpg"],
    "category": "Gifts"
  }
  ```

### 3. Trader Joe's Scraper
- **Categories Scraped**: Flowers & Plants, Beverages, Everything Else.
- **Details Extracted**:
  - Product title, description, price, ingredients (if available), images.
  
- **How It Works**:
  - The script visits each category, scrapes product links, and navigates to individual product pages.
  - It gathers detailed product information and handles multiple pages of results by clicking the "Next" button.
  
- **Sample Output**:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Trader Joe's Organic Juice",
    "description": "A refreshing organic juice made from the finest fruits.",
    "price": 5.99,
    "ingredients": ["Water", "Apple Juice Concentrate", "Natural Flavors"],
    "images": ["https://www.traderjoes.com/image1.jpg"],
    "category": "Beverages"
  }
  ```

## Output Files
Each script generates the following output:
- A **JSON file** with detailed product data:
  - `output/foreignfortune.json`
  - `output/lechocolat.json`
  - `output/traderjoes.json`
- A **summary text file** with the total number of products scraped:
  - `output/foreignfortune_count.txt`
  - `output/lechocolat_count.txt`
  - `output/traderjoes_count.txt`

## Customizations
### 1. Changing the Category List
You can modify the category URLs and names in each script to scrape different sections of the websites. For example, in `foreignfortune.py`:
```python
categories = [
    {"url": "https://foreignfortune.com/collections/new-arrivals", "name": "New Arrivals"}
]
```

### 2. Adjusting Headless Mode
By default, the scripts are set to run in non-headless mode (you can see the browser). You can switch to headless mode by changing:
```python
browser = await launch(headless=True)
```

### 3. Handling Dynamic Elements
You can modify the `waitForXPath` and `waitForSelector` calls to adapt to different elements or slower-loading pages.

## Common Issues and Debugging
### 1. Timeout Issues
- If the website takes too long to load, increase the timeout values in the `waitForXPath` or `goto` methods:
  ```python
  await page.goto(url, timeout=90000)
  ```

### 2. Missing Data
- If some elements are not scraped, double-check the XPath expressions in the script. Websites may change their HTML structure over time.

### 3. Popups
- If popups appear on certain pages, the script already has a built-in mechanism to close them. You can modify the popup closing logic if needed.
